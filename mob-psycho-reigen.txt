It's like you're a little kid with a knife or something. I can't bear to watch. What's with all that stuff on your forehead? 
And what's with these goofy things that look like shoulder pads? They're fashion accessories. They don't serve any real purpose. 
You guys just don't get it. No matter what kind of special powers you may have, you're still only human. No more, no less. 
It's the same for everybody. But somehow, you've all forgotten that. You're so addicted to your special powers you've developed tunnel vision. 
You want world domination but you haven't seen the world. No one's going to follow you knowing that. Don't make me laugh. 
First, get rid of those ridiculous shoulder pads and grow up. You too - you just want to escape from society, right? 
If you want to make it big, you have to live in reality. Consider that the starting point. 

...Think about who... you are for a second! You're just a cog in the population! Look, I'M a commoner, and I'm much more powerful than any of you will ever be! 
So tell me - what... does that make you?
