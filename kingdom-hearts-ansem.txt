I have dedicated most of my life in the pursuit of knowledge and have used that knowledge to guard this world. People respect me and greet me with a smile and not a single soul doubts my dedication. But still there are things even I don’t understand.
I have witnessed that darkness sleeps in every heart, it doesn’t matter how pure one’s heart is. Darkens can start even from the smallest drop, spread and eventually swallow the heart.
Darkness…Darkness of the heart. How is it born?
As a ruler of this world, I must find how this darkness comes to affect us, I must find them before the world is lost to those taken by the darkness.
