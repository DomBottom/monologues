I found out months later: that night, on a rooftop down the block, two teenage kids got in a fight
over a crack pipe. Something that would destroy them, and they both fought over it - like
anorexics gobbling laxatives, like Socrates gasping for more poison. One of them pulled a knife.
The other held on to the pipe - refused to relinquish his slow destruction in the face of imminent
death. The first kid stabbed him. Another New York tragedy. Another moment, as meaningless as
Captain Coleman’s last show... But in that moment, in that moment, they both realized
everything there was to learn from that scene. The kid with the knife in his gut looked up, and he
reached out with the pipe - he offered it up... like: Here. Take it, it’s not worth fighting over. As
he did so, he fell backwards, off the roof. He tumbled down, but he landed on a fire escape. The
pipe fell to the street, and smashed into a million tiny shards of light. So one kid ran away into
the night, and the other was left, broken on a fire escape - his life blood dripping onto a dark
street, unseen. ... I walked through it, didn’t have a clue. Sally got hit on the head by it... still
didn’t get it. We never called an ambulance - because we didn’t know how the world was right
then... sometimes, you just don’t know what’s going on. You just have to... to find out.
That’s just a part of the world. But you get through it - a lot of it’s pretty fun. Helps to have
someone to laugh at it all with you. So hey... welcome to the world. I think you’ll fit in.
