A seagull is being interviewed at the beach when his seagull friends see someone unwrapping a turkey sandwich.

Do you have any idea how tough it is to be a seagull? The competition is fierce, and you gotta fight for every scrap! Oh, hang on, inbound sandwich!

Ugh, bummer, missed my chance. And with these thieven thugs, you don’t get a second chance. Ooops, wait, cupcake! I’m on it!
