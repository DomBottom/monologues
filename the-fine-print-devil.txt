DEVIL
If the remote weapon can recognise targets and... eliminate them, without the operator
ever having to see their faces - it would make the onus of a soldier less burdensome.

I mean - you need to design it right. But if a casino can tell exactly who you are by
matching faces to a national registry of licensed drivers, don’t you think you can design a
weapons system that can tell the difference between an enemy combatant and a platoon of known
individuals, all issued with whatever protective back up electronic signal you think up? It could
be built into their dogtags. You could be the architect that ended the casualties of “friendly fire”
forever. Just think... a U.S. soldier, operating a remote weapon from perfect safety, able to
destroy whatever man woman or child he’s directed to - without seeing one drop of blood,
without looking at one human face. And I’m not talking about indiscriminate carpet bombing
with all the messy political implications, I mean one shot, one kill. One person - known, named,
identified human being, completely removed of any humanity. Disposable. Killed without a
single quiver of messy emotional consequence or human empathy. It’s the final solution.
