War is no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It has changed into an endless series of proxy battles fought by mercenaries and machines. War – and its consumption of life – has become a well-oiled machine. War has changed. ID-tagged soldiers carry ID-tagged weapons, use ID-tagged gear.
Genetic control. Information control. Emotion control. Battlefiled control. War has changed. Everything is monitored by nanomachines inside the bodies, which also regulate and enhance their abilities while keeping them under control. The age of deterrence has become the age of control . . . All in the name of averting catastrophe from weapons of mass destruction. And he who controls the battlefield . . . controls history. War has changed. When the battlefield is under total control . . . War becomes routine.
