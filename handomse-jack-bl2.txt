“Why don’t you bad guys just die quickly? I don’t get it! Everyone knows the hero’s gonna win in the end. Example: There’s this guy in New Haven, right? The city’s burning, people are dying, yadda, yadda, yadda… This jackhole rushes me with a spoon, A FRICKIN’ SPOON! And I’m dying laughing, right? So I scoop out his stupid little eyeballs with it and his kids are all, ‘WAAAAAAH!’ And-ahahaha… I can’t even… ahahahahah! Now he’s bumbing into stuff as he can’t see where he is going and… I dunno, maybe you had to be there. The moral is: you’re a total bitch”.
